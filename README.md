============

 The references are taken from [101][1],[102][2],[HAXE and NODE][3] and [this repo][4]

Here is an experiment of JS development with HAXE.


```
haxe build.hxml
```

That will generate a single JS file inside `bin` folder, the `bin` folder will be created, if its not present.

#### NodeJS
 The reference is taken from [this doc][5]          

```
haxe -lib hxnodejs -main Main -js main.js
```
